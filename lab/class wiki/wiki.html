            but also garnered large support at the
            Troubadour in Los Angeles with an extended residency spanning 6 months.[1] They signed with RCA Records in
            December 2000, they continued to tour taking slots supporting such diverse acts as Mogwai, Ben Harper, Iggy Pop and The Stooges, Bj√∂rk, Darkest Hour, Bloodlet, Wu-Tang Clan, Poison The Well, Killswitch Engage, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Atreyu. They released a four-track EP in 2002 before issuing their full-length album, The Routine in the summer of 2003. They followed the release of the album with a slot on the Ozzfest tour that year as well as making time for the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan.[1] A single from the album, "Not Today", was a hit on American rock radio, peaking at No. 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.[2] The band broke up soon after the Ozzfest tour despite accumulating much new material but citing both mismanagement of funds by their management and personal reasons.
