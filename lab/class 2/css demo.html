  <p>"Wake up Alex, time for breakfast." My mom was cooking something in the kitchen, making the whole house smell like bread. After a long yawn,
   I looked out the window, the swimming pool was refilled with clean water. Under the sunshine it looked like a huge crystal, shiny and reflecting
   a blue light on the wall. Flowers in the yard were blooming, fresh and energetic, attracting me to join the runners on the street. What a nice day!
   Everything was normal, real, yet magical.</p>

  <p>How wonderful that I can expect to see such beauty day after day, as I have been seeing them since I was born. I do not know why things are this way,
    there is one thing I know, and I believe IN it deeply--this world is logical, and it is designed. </p>

  <p>Every thing on the earth has its own name, and each of them expresses itself in a form. This form itself is unique and representative, which is A type
    of art. From these art genres, if I have the ability to combine them and create something new, make composite art, it would be fantastic. Based on this
     idea, I have found the goal of my life, I want to be a designer. My dream is to design something that can represent a new form, something original and
     unprecedented To bring about new unique forms of beautiful arts to peopleâ€™s life.</p>

  <p>I have been working on many fields to improve my sense of art, from writing to filming, from graphic arts to music and photography, and have developed
  well-rounded personal quality. I have passion for art from deep inside, because art is as sacred as nature. I find it hard to describe a view or feeling
  by words, but I can use art to achieve the goal. </p>

  <p>Graphic art is to present a graceful scene in my mind. They are always complicated because I need to give a lot of considerations to what style I use.
     I had this idea when I was trying to design a flower picture, the flower is just a plant, but you can read a mood from the dark red color of petals
     and the restrained way it blooms. When feeling the flower on the screen has life and meanings, I know it is a beautiful graphic. I will make the
     drawings to not only keep some important elements of the real thing, but also contain artistic fantasies. I have created pictures with different styles,
    such as pop art, fauvism, cartoon, arcimboldo. </p>

  <p>The trend of art is becoming digitalized very quickly. Today, technology is making great changes in art and entertainment. To make art refreshing and
    innovative, artists should use the most advanced technologies. I will seize this opportunity and make myself an artist of the future to bring more
    forms of arts to this world. </p>
