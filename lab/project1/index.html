    Doree had to take three buses—one to Kincardine, where she waited for one to London,
    where she waited again, for the city bus out to the facility. She started the trip on a Sunday
    at nine in the morning. Because of the waiting times between buses, it took her until about two
    in the afternoon to travel the hundred-odd miles. All that sitting, either on buses or in the depots,
    was not a thing she should have minded. Her daily work was not of the sitting-down kind.
    She was a chambermaid at the Comfort Inn. She scrubbed bathrooms and stripped and made beds and
    vacuumed rugs and wiped mirrors. She liked the work—it occupied her thoughts to a certain extent
    and tired her out so that she could sleep at night. She was seldom faced with a really bad mess,
    though some of the women she worked with could tell stories to make your hair curl. These women
    were older than her, and they all thought that she should try to work her way up. They told her
    that she should get trained for a job behind the desk, while she was still young and decent-looking.
    But she was content to do what she did. She didn’t want to have to talk to people.

     I struggled to recall the last occasion that I’d seen my wife naked, and it had been bright enough to
     see her properly. Not that year, for sure; I wasn’t even certain that it had happened the year before.
     How could I have failed to notice such deep bruises on the body of the only person I lived with? I tried
     to count the fine wrinkles radiating out from the corners of my wife’s eyes. Then I told her to take off
     all her clothes. A red flush appeared along the line of her cheekbones, which her weight loss had left
     indecently sharp. She tried to remonstrate with me.

      Tony Gardner had been my mother’s favourite. Back home, back in the communist days, it had been really hard
      to get records like that, but my mother had pretty much his whole collection. Once when I was a boy, I
      scratched one of those precious records. The apartment was so cramped, and a boy my age, you just had to move
      around sometimes, especially during those cold months when you couldn’t go outside. So I was playing this
      game jumping from our little sofa to the armchair, and one time I misjudged it and hit the record player. The
      needle went across the record with a zip—this was long before CDs—and my mother came in from the kitchen and
      began shouting at me. I felt so bad, not just because she was shouting at me, but because I knew it was one of
      Tony Gardner’s records, and I knew how much it meant to her. And I knew that this one too would now have those
      popping noises going through it while he crooned those American songs. Years later, when I was working in Warsaw
      and I got to know about black-market records, I gave my mother replacements of all her worn-out Tony Gardner albums,
      including that one I scratched. It took me over three years, but I kept getting them, one by one, and each time
      I went back to see her I’d bring her another.

    The morning Henry Evans stopped by my office to tell me to go to Chicago, I was in the middle of my
    chapter-a-day habit: still in the Book of Hosea, much to my dismay, still in the Old Testament after years
    of dogged reading. This habit required skimming the day’s chapter of the Bible (usually the length of one
    onion-skin page), then reading the extensive commentaries in the footnotes, then finally reading the chapter
    again—all of this took on average forty-five minutes. I did this at work because it was where I lived—fourteen
    hours a day, often six days a week. I couldn’t help knowing some of the Bible because I was a P.K. (preacher’s
    kid), but I’d started reading this fat copy of the NIV Study Bible with its elephant-gray leather cover because
    my mother left it for me along with her modest wedding jewelry when she died three years ago.

      We have nothing. Out here, we have only ourselves.</br>
      This is all new to us. Once upon a time, we were in the big city, and the population of our neighborhood—a
      small district in a large borough in one of the nation’s largest cities—the population of just our neighborhood
      was ten times bigger than the population of our entire city today. If you can call it a city. Everything here is
      called Village Something: the Village Laundromat, the Village Stationery, the Village Tavern, the Village Pizza,
      the Village Freez (an ice cream stand), the Village Idiot (a bar). It doesn’t pretend to be what it’s not.</br>
      It is not a lot. We left everything behind. I had nothing to do with it. I had nothing. It was Azita; Azita had it all.

      I descended the stairs to the living room and master bedroom. I had a strong urge to touch everything, my hands
      sweeping over marble, mahogany, satin, and velvet. In the bedroom, I rubbed the wallpaper, my hand grazing the
      soft fabric in wide sweeps. I sat on the bed, caressed the pillow, lay my head down. I usually loved smelling the
      scents of my parents on their bed, but something here was peculiar. I smelled foreign cologne. I stood back up,
      looked around, and saw one of my father’s watches. It was his room all right.</br>
      I ran up the winding stairs, grabbed a washcloth from the bathroom, dropped my jeans, jumped onto my bed, and humped
      the soft fabric of the bedcover. Soft, rich, lush, it did not take long. I barely managed to cover my penis with the
      washcloth.

     Perhaps my fate was sealed when I sold my three-year-old sister. My father had taken me to a couple of cattle auctions,
     not minding that I was a girl–this was before Missy was born, of course–and I’d loved the fast talk and the intensity of
     the whole thing. So the day after my seventh birthday party, where Missy did a song for everyone while I sat alone, my
     chin on my hand, and meditated behind my still uncut birthday cake, it seemed to me that here was a charming and beautiful
     little asset that I had no further use for and could be liquidated to good effect. So I gathered a passel of children from
     our gated community in Houston, kids with serious money, and I had Missy do a bit of her song once more, and I said, “Ladies
     and gentlemen, no greater or more complete perfection of animal beauty ever stood on two legs than the little girl who stands
     before you. She has prizewinning breeding and good teeth. She will neither hook, kick, strike, nor bite you. She is the pride
     and joy and greatest treasure of the Dickerson family and she is now available to you. Who will start the bidding for this
     future blue-ribbon winner? Who’ll offer fifty cents? Fifty cents. Who’ll give me fifty?” I saw nothing but blank stares before
     me. I’d gotten all these kids together but I still hadn’t quite gotten them into the spirit of the thing. So I looked one of
     these kids in the eye and I said, “You, Tony Speck. Aren’t your parents rich enough to give you an allowance of fifty cents?”
     He made a hard, scrunched-up face and he said, “A dollar.” And I was off. I finally sold her for six dollars and twenty-five
     cents to a quiet girl up the street whose daddy was in oil. She was an only child, a thing I made her feel sorry about when
     the bidding slowed down at five bucks.

    You can barely manage movement in the big one-piece buba you borrowed from Comfort, your cousin, under duress. The off-the-shoulder
    neckline keeps slipping to your elbow, exposing your (troublingly) flat chest. Absent breasts, the hem drags and gets caught
    underfoot, a malfunction exacerbated by your footwear, also Comfort’s: gold leather stilettos two sizes too small with a thick
    crust of sequins and straps of no use. You’ve been tripping and falling around the garden all evening, with night-damp earth
    sucking at the heels of the shoes, the excess folds of the buba sort of draped around your body, making you look like a black
    Statue of Liberty.

     Eugene was a scholarship boy. One of his teachers had told him that he was too smart to be going to a regular high school and
     gave him a list of prep schools. Eugene applied to all of them—”just for the hell of it”—and all of them accepted him. He
     finally decided on Choate because only Choate had offered him a travel allowance. His father was dead and his mother, a nurse,
     had three other kids to support, so Eugene didn’t think it would be fair to ask her for anything. As the train came into
     Wallingford he asked me if I would be his roommate.
