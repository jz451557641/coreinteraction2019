      First: The writer thinks it is important for us to know the importance of research. A question can not only have one answer, to
      get the better answer, we should not only foucs on the result, but also the reasearching process. During our reseaching process the problems we
      face would challenge us to look things in a different way and it would help us to extend our knowledge efficiently.</br>
      Second: The writer encourges me to chase what I like. Sometimes when you are really interested into something, you will dig deeper into the obejct,
      we will not do something for money, instead we would become part of the object and feel the spirit and meaning inside of it. A well-known culture piece
      can be attractive, but we can also find out other useful things by ourselves.</br>
      Third: As normal people, our knowledge and ability is very limited. What we can do is to control things that owned by us. A web is created through our
      coding word by word, we know the essence and base of it, so we can find ways to control it. Websites we created are like our own children, we are the
      maker, give the birth of it, and we will also be responsible to its future, how it grow and what is its position in this large net.</br>
      I have collected greeting cards from my very young age, those greeting cards I recieved from different festivals or birthdays in different years reminds
      me who I was. Through reading them I can see what others think about me during that time and how I changed over the years. These readings helped me to
      pursue my purpose of collecting things and I will continue to collect meaningful things.
