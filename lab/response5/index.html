      <p>
      After reading the article, I have feeling that coding is probably one of the most strict programe in the world. It is fair, direct, organized and <br>
      can be supervised by everyone. In our society today, tons of information are going on in the internet, many people call it as "the century of information". <br>
      And what does internet made of? Of course it is coding. The article use many scenes to explain and reveal its point. We are all living in our own lifes, <br>
      doing our own things, but in fact we are all influenced by coding. We can not live with out it because it is part of our life invisiblly even for those<br>
      who do not know how to code. Humans are different from animals, we think the origin of things, the author encourages the general public to know about <br>
      coding because it is the origin of many things. And it will be lasted forever. It is a better choice for everyone to be familiar of coding, which is<br>
      influencing us every second.
