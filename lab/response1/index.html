      <h1>Response 1</h1>
      <p>
        After read those three different resouces, I felt each of the website is expressing their ideas in unique ways.
        You can really get their points by just looking at their websites.
        The first reading is "How to learn CSS", CSS is to make a website more colorful, attractive and organized. So the website, which
        the reading is on, is actually a pretty successful example with excellent CSS. The second reading is about energy conservation
        and environment protection. The the website they made is purposely low-tech, direct and as simple as possible. You can see very few
        other elements because I guess the creator want people to focus on the text and not get distracted by other things.
        The third reading's idea is to encourge people to create things in a more direct and useful way. In the century we have too much information
        exploding on the internet, we really need to make things rightly to better improve our efficiency.
