        When I get to learn html and css, I was amazed by its logical, complex but clear language. Every term is independent by it self, but by putting<br>
        them together they could make a fantastic new world. Like the Postel's Law said, "Be conservative in what you send; be liberal in what you accept."<br>
        When we type in codes, we follow the rules of the language, be careful with the organization and lables as much as possible, but in our mind, we<br>
        are also thinking about something really creative or interesting. I do feel I am making something special with a tool that every designer is common<br>
        with. Whatever we create, it will be shown in the browser. I considered myself to be a very free person, I never liked rules or instructions. But<br>
        then I realized, I can only be free within an orderly environment. So do the language. Instructions aren't there to limit people's immagination, but<br>
        help them to get on the path that more convinient to create. Another good thing about html or css language is that you get to control everything.<br>
        Codes can not think by itself, you decide the way they work on the screen, even one punctuation can make a huge difference.
