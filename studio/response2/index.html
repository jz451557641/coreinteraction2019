        This "Exercise in Style" book is quite different from the readings I had before. Usually in a story,
        the readers can know the protagonist pretty quickly. But in this book, the "long-necked man" looks very strange to me.
        And the stroy it is telling seems has no highlight or special. I can only analyze those characters by some small events happened
        in the story. During the reading process I just felt how interesting and funny this society is. I also know there is a different power in the language,
        the unique way of telling a story just draw my attention more into each character of the book instead of focusing on the plot.
