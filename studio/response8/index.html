      <h1>Response 8</h1>
      <p>
        From elemantray school, I had been taught by the teacher that "time is relevant." We have no control over it, but we can manage our emotions or feelings to
        it. It is interesting to think about who actually defines a day which is 24 hours. The 24 hours is discovered and analyzed by who. If time is free and countinuesly, why
        can't we just do not have a duration of time and just let time keep moving by itself endlessly. Our pursue to fullfill a day seems becoming meaningless in front of time.
        But time organized everything and giving us everything we have.
