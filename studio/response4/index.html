    I have wondered the relationships between art and design. I think this article solved some of my concerns. Art is for people to feel, it transmits emotion
    or ideas. But design is more likely for economic purposes. We do not just design just because we need it, we design because of our pursue for a better quality
    life. Design can be classified by different fields such as science, business, fashion etc. Because different fields' designs are totally different just like those
    fields themselves. As the time goes, our desire for having improved design will become bigger, public taste will change and things we need to design will be more
    and more detailed, the pursue is endless. As designers, we need to have a patient and passion heart, because design decides how the world look.
