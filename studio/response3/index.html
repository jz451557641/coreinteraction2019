       This essay anwsered some questions I always had about today's web design. When I was a kid in China, I learned a little bit about
       designing a web, to me at that time it was just a way to put information on the internet. I did not concern the art or people's
       asthetics in it. I think in the past, go on a website was a process to look for information, but today it is an experience. Our standardize
			 of viewing a website is becoming much higher. To be a good web designer, you are not only need to be a programer, you also have to
			 be a good graphic artist.
