      <p>
        Milions of websites can have milions of outlooks. UI, as the first thing we get to see when we go
        on a platform, is responsible for the first impression of people about certain products or services.
        This website taught me how to design the apearance of the UI detailly. The color, layout and typography we choose
        should all fit each other and make a clear but nice composition. How we present the menu and other functions of
        an app can play a very big role on custumers' decisions. I never learned how to make a good UI before, but
        I believe some points are the same with graphic or web design, how we make things to make visual pleasure for
        people and bring good experience are the main goals.
