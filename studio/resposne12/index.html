      <h1>Response 12</h1>
      <p>
        Each person has his own idea and our worldview or inspirations are based on individualâ€™s experiences.
         That means every person should not be the same and has unique talents. Concept is usually a guide that
         leads us to the path and some basic rules we need to follow, it should not be a big factory that produces
         similar products. Our imagination and creativity are the main source of works of art, not concepts that
         made by others. The author suggest artists and authors to not limit themselves within a boundary and value
          the quality of art more than the origination of content. Be able to create things original and special.
