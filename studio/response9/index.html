      <p>
      I have never thought about design of typography seriously, I could only feel some characteristics such as elegant, wild,
       fictional or technological etc, through some different styles of fonts. The author, a typography designer, draws inspiration
       from his experience and apply elements he discovered from the environment to his work, which is very creative and challenging.
       The patterns and shape of any objects from the real life can be reflected on typography, because they share some similar qualities
       that can be transferred and used by each other. It is also an interesting idea that each typography is a picture, typography influences
        the way we look at sentences or words. That is why we need new typographers to better support new contents or thoughts.
