        Social medias are important to internet, memes is important to social medias. Personally I really like to use different kinds of memes just because
        they are funny. But memes contain certain cultures in them too. Memes' special property give its various replications and large amount of productions.
        They can be used by anyone and almost all feelings and emotions can be reflected and presented by memes after people's creative process. The reason why
        we choose to send memes instead of texts is because memes give people a visual explanation to something. Other can understand your thoughts or feel your mood
        more easily. I think the author means that seperate memes freely are like giving an environment to do things freely, more and more freeedom will bring conflicts
        between freedom and order.
