        I had never thought about the meaning of a website, I thought it was just like other existing things we have today, created to achieve particular purposes. But in the article, the author elaborates a very interesting idea. A website can be living, it can help to form a person's identity.

  In order to keep the website survive, we need to clarify the property of it first, then suit the remedy to the case. The author illustrates different types of the website by comparing it to a room, a plant or a shelf etc. Different platforms will need different plans to help the website grow.

  I realize that if I view the website as a tool, or just an assignment I have to complete, the website will be dead after I publishing it.  But if I put my own perspective during the process, give the website its own identity, the website will be much more abundant and has a soul within it.
