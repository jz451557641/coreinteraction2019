	<p>The cyberpunk city rarely comes from a single cultural viewpoint. It is most common for the city to be an architectural “melting pot,” designs lifted from all corners of the world . . . or, in the case of tales in which mankind has touched the stars, architectural designs taken from every nook and crany of the galaxy. Western and eastern designs sit across from each other or, at times, smash and blur together to form buildings that appear both familiar and otherworldly all at once.</br>
This blending of architectural styles mirrors the population of the city, with the city’s predominant architectural style coming straight from its dominant culture. The city is located in Southeast Asia? It will look more like a futuristic variant of Tokyo or Hong Kong than if the city straddles the ruins of Chicago.
