	<p>In the dystopian city of most cyberpunk worlds there is rain. From a steady drizzle to a horrific downpour, rain permeates the city and washes away the hope and cheer of the population. Rain in the cyberpunk city is not a cleansing agent.</br>
Rain doesn’t remove filth. Rain doesn’t banish dust. Rain doesn’t remove the grime and despair from the streets and alleys. Instead, rain in our cyberpunk city comes down as a dark, disgusting wave of tainted waters that has collected the dirt and pollution from the skies and buildings and pours another layer of surrender over the “man on the street” common folk.</br>
Rain represents the hopelessness of the cyberpunk city and instills in the people a depression that can never be shaken.
