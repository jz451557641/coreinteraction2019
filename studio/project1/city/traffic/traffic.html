	<p>Whether it is space ships traveling to and from the world, flying cars hovering over the skyscrapers, or even drones and robots following orders as they maneuver through the skyways, the skies of our cyberpunk city are rarely free of movement. A never-ending buzz of machinery at flight, the aerial traffic of a cyberpunk city is so ubiquitous that it fades into the background and is soon forgotten.</br>
In the cyberpunk city the traffic extends skyward, reaching to the highest towers and in some cities — such as we see in The Fifth Element — allowing the wealthy to move throughout the world without ever setting foot in the slums below.</br>
