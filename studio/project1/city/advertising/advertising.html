	<p>You cannot escape the advertisers in the cyberpunk city. Walls are covered in billboards, screens, and holographic advertisements that blanket most of your field of vision with demands for your attention, brand loyalty, and cash. And straight from Minority Report, many times these advertisements recognize you and target you directly, tapping into your purchasing history, public records, and private digital trail in order to tailor the message directly to you.</br>
You cannot escape the advertisers of this future world. If the world’s inhabitants use Google Glass-like shades then a steady stream of commercials run in the corner or your eye. Your web browser is always flashing ads at you. Even your car is a tool for the advertisers, broadcasting your location at all times so that the advertisements remain just a few seconds ahead of your needs.</br>
This constant barrage of advertising numbs the population, making it tougher each year to reach people with a message. As the people become immune to the advertising methods of yesterday, the corporations improve on their techniques for tomorrow.</br>
