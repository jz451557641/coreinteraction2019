	<p>Bridges reaching, connecting skyscraper to skyscraper, nothing below except the street which is dozens of floors down, these walkways criss-cross the city and grant people mobility without descending to the streets or forcing them to rely on aerial transport.</br>
Unlike the sky-bridges of our modern world, these futuristic walkways of the cyberpunk city are as packed and crowded as the streets below and skies above.</br>
What makes these walkways especially fun for stories is that these bridges create a way for aerial traffic to interact with pedestrian traffic . . . and all tens of stories above the filthy streets. You can never tell who — or what! — will be on one of these walkways; is it a robotic enforcer, a beat cop, or a street merchant selling stale food and warm drinks?</br>
