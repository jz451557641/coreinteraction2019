	<p>Whereas our other cyberpunk city tropes are inanimate atmospheric devices and completely location-specific, the police and corporate security forces of the cyberpunk city are so ingrained in the landscape that they may as well be another building or landmark of the world. The police marching in The Fifth Element, CJ Cherryh’s protagonist in the “Mech” short story (found in Altered States), and even Douglas Quaid’s pursuers in Total Recall are all examples of this trope in action.</br>
In the cyberpunk city, police and corporate security are everywhere . . . and they likely are totalitarian fascists who exist only to serve their superiors. The welfare and security of the people are often so far from the authority’s purpose that citizens are enslaved, murdered, and crushed as the forces in control maneuver to complete their goals.</br>
Like the rain, the police and corporate security are an unrelenting force of nature that simply makes life miserable for the common population of the city.
