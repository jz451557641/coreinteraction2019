      <h1>Response 11</h1>
      <p>
        Everything is changed for a reason. There are many possibilities for designing, just like art, we can not make everyone to accept <br>
        or like it. But at least we can be diversitied with some of our works, so there will be more approvements. It is right to stick to the plan,
        but it is also right that if anything goes wrong, we should have a preparation for it. Present the core idea of a project in a different way
        is acceptable and positive. The structure of design is certainly important, but since there are many forms of structure, we can choose wisely
        organize the project to a right way.
