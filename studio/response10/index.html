      <p>
        Like any other forms of art, typography has been changed from time to time. The way we create typography are becoming
        much more easier and convinient. It is not true that typography we have today are better than these we created in the past,
        but they have more different art elements and opotions for people to choose because of digital technology. I believe there
        is no good type or bad type, we just need different typographies in different places. The competetion between companies over
        typography bring positivie influence to the field and make overall quality of typography improved. In the future we might
        have new ways to program or create typography, our way to read or listen can even be changed by new techology. The important
        thing is we should never lose our feelings to words or sentences.
